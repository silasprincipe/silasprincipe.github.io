      <title>Meio De Cultura</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Role: coordinator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outreach project &amp;ldquo;Meio de Cultura&amp;rdquo; (culture medium, in free translation) is an extension activity at UFSCar Sorocaba, a public federal university from Sorocaba, São Paulo state, Brazil. The project&amp;rsquo;s purpose is “to nurture the interaction between the university and the community, being a means of expanding and transforming knowledge”. Our team consists of servers and students from UFSCar Sorocaba, all motivated by the passion and the desire to communicate science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main activities are developed in partnership with city institutions. We highlight the partnership with the Sorocaba Zoo, in which we are updating their outreach project of &amp;ldquo;Kit zoos&amp;rdquo;. Those kits are used in schools of the region to teach about zoology, ecology and conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also organizing a Festival of Scientific Communication to be run on July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coral Reefs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite being one of the most productive and diverse ecosystems of the world, coral reefs are also one of the most threatened in the Anthropocene. In this project we will use Ecological Niche Modelling techniques to trace and predict the impacts of climate change on keystone species of reef ecosystems in the Atlantic ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thermal biology of fiddler crabs</title>
      <link>https://silasprincipe.github.io/project/thermal-biology/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Marine organisms are facing unprecedent challenges due to climate change. Understand how those changes, especially temperaure increase, will affect organisms is essential. In this project we used an intertidal organism, which is in the interface between land and ocean, to study the effects of temperature increase and dessication on the organismal physiology. We compared the effects in two fiddler crab species which inhabits distinct areas of the mangrove (one more exposed to desiccation stress and the other in shadowed areas). We are also employing new techiniques to understand how those organisms deal with thermal control (still ongoing).&lt;/p&gt;
