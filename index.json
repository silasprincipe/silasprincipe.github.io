The field of marine science, our own topic of interest, has also been impacted in multiple ways, from cancelation of laboratory and field activities to postponement of onboard research. As graduate researchers, we have a time-sensitive academic path, and our current situation may constrain our academic future. At the same time, the pandemic demands revised strategies to deal with the ongoing difficulties and tackle similar future situations. In this perspective, we have gathered information on the challenges, solutions and opportunities for graduate researchers in the field of marine science by (1) discussing the relevant short-, long-term challenges caused by the pandemic, (2) providing feasible immediate and near-future solutions, (3) compiling opportunities (courses, scientific events, academic positions), and (4) creating a shared social media account to make the available information on new opportunities more accessible. With this, we hope to add to the efforts to advance the academic career of marine graduates during this harsh period.","tags":[],"title":"Advancing Through the Pandemic From the Perspective of Marine Graduate Researchers: Challenges, Solutions, and Opportunities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Principe","Silas C.","Lotufo","Tito M.C.","Acosta","A."],"categories":[],"content":"Despite being one of the most productive and diverse ecosystems of the world, coral reefs are also one of the most threatened in the Anthropocene.

They are one of the most threatened ecosystems by urbanization processes. In this context, we developed a conceptual framework for the management of biodiversity and ecosystem services for these coastal environments. We based our workflow on two sections: “Information base” and “Governance” and use the Puerto Morelos Coastal region as a case study for coastal protection. Puerto Morelos is between two of the most touristic destinations of Mexico (Playa del Carmen and Cancun) that has experienced an increase of population in the past four decades resulting in an intensification of multiple threats to its ecosystems. We characterized the two ecosystems with a “Management Units” strategy. An expert-based ecosystem services matrix was also described in order to connect mangroves and coral reef ecosystems with the multiple beneficiaries. Then an ecosystem model (conceptual model and Global Biodiversity model) was developed. The conceptual model was useful in understanding the interplay processes between systems regarding the ecosystem service of “Coastal Protection”. The Global Biodiversity model evidenced the human-induced shifts in the biodiversity for mangrove and coral reefs ecosystems. Also, a projection for 2035 of “best” and “worst” scenarios was applied using GLOBIO3. A DPSIR conceptual framework was used to analyze environmental problems regarding ecosystem services maintenance. Finally, we evaluated a set of policies associated with these ecosystems that favor coastal protection integrity. This framework facilitates the identification of the most relevant processes and controls about the provision of coastal protection service. It can also be useful to better target management actions and as a tool to identify future management needs to tackle the challenges preventing more effective conservation of coastal environments.","tags":[],"title":"Development of a conceptual framework for the management of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Mexican Caribbean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Principe","Silas C.","Augusto","Alessandra","Costa","Tânia Marcia"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546882639,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546882639,"objectID":"1a2c5eac95c862eb11519761078c6df9","permalink":"https://silasprincipe.github.io/publication/glucose/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T14:37:19-03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/glucose/","section":"publication","summary":"Blood glucose is widely used as a physiological parameter for vertebrates and invertebrates. However, its measurement in the field is often difficult due to the need for expensive and non-portable equipment. Point-of-care (POC) devices, originally intended for human use, are increasingly being used for measuring blood parameters of animals in the field. In this regard, POC glucose meters are becoming valuable tools for conservation physiologists, as glucose can be a useful indicator of stress response. In invertebrates, the use of POC glucose meters is still scarce, and no study yet has evaluated their usability in crustaceans and molluscs. We tested if a POC device can be used to measure haemolymph glucose in two widely used models, Leptuca thayeri and Perna perna, compared with a standard laboratory method. The device was unable to measure glucose in P. perna haemolymph due to equipment inaccuracy and low glucose concentration in this species (10.13±6.25 mg/dL). Additionally, despite the device being capable of measuring glucose in L. thayeri haemolymph, Bland–Altman plots showed a strong bias and wide limits of agreement, and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient showed a weak concordance between methods. When simulating experimental conditions, POC results differed from those found using the standard method. We conclude that POC glucose meters are unsuitable for assessing glucose in mussels and should not be used in crabs as results are inaccurate.","tags":["fiddler crab","glucose","Leptuca thayeri","molluscs","Perna perna","portable meter"],"title":"Point-of-care testing for measuring haemolymph glucose in invertebrates is not a valid method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Principe","Silas C.","Augusto","Alessandra","Costa","Tânia Marcia"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514828239,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514828239,"objectID":"8c063a6bece45713c0543d9d1f49a4ed","permalink":"https://silasprincipe.github.io/publication/uca-thermal/","publishdate":"2020-06-04T18:16:03-03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/uca-thermal/","section":"publication","summary":"Temperature is one of the main environmental constraints to organism distribution, affecting physiology and survival. Organisms that inhabit the intertidal zone are exposed to temperature variation and, with climate change, they should face different conditions which include higher temperatures, leading to higher rates of water loss through evaporation and then fitness reduction or mortality. Here we tested the effects of desiccation and increased temperature in two fiddler crabs species that occupy distinct habitats in regard to vegetation cover and position on the intertidal zone and thus may respond differently to these stressors. Leptuca thayeri, which is restricted to the mid-tide zone and vegetated areas, had higher desiccation and mortality rates than Minuca rapax, a generalist species, when exposed to desiccation for 120 min. Also, compared to M. rapax, L. thayeri had a more permeable carapace. Temperature elevation of 10 °C and 20 °C for 72 h caused no mortality in either species. However, there were changes in hemolymph osmolality and muscle hydration in both species. Leptuca thayeri osmolality was low in the intermediate temperature, suggesting that at this temperature this species has a better salt secretion capability. Minuca rapax, however, had an increase in hemolymph osmolality at the highest temperatures with no LDH increase, which indicates that osmotic control in this species is more sensitive to temperature increase. Our results show that L. thayeri suffers more from desiccation, due to a more permeable carapace. However, because of this higher permeability L. thayeri is capable of lowering its temperature more than M. rapax. As temperature elevation produces great physiological changes in M. rapax, a reduced ability to keep a low temperature can be an issue for this species if temperature increases. However, higher water loss to keep body temperature low may decrease L. thayeri survivability in the same scenario.","tags":["Desiccation; Leptuca thayeri; Minuca rapax; Thermal ecology; Thermal physiology"],"title":"Effects of water loss and temperature increase in fiddler crabs","type":"publication"}]
