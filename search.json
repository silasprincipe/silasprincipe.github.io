I contribute to the EU Horizon project MPA Europe, where our work package, in collaboration with partners, is generating species distribution models for over 12,000 marine species occurring in European waters. This supports the prioritization analysis that aims to map optimal locations for marine protected areas in Europe.\nMy research interests focus primarily on how climate change affects ecosystems, with experience in distribution modelling, thermal biology, and ecophysiology.
